In the beginning, there was =prot-logos.el=.  A file that loaded some
configurations I had for presentations (part of [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles][my dotfiles]]).  On
2022-03-02 I decided to take the code out of my personal setup and turn
it into a package.  It occured to me that "logos" is a nice word though
it might be a bit dull for an Emacs package, so I coined the backcronyms
"^L Only Generates Ostensible Slides" and "Logos Optionally Garners
Outline Sections", which hopefully describe what this is all about.
Read the manual for the technicalities.
